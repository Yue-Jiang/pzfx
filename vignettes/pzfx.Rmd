# Background
Prism GraphPad is a software application for scientific graphing, curve fitting and statistical testing. It has been popular among scientists, especially experimental biologists. The `pzfx` R package provides an easy way to read data tables that are in Prism GraphPad format (`.pzfx` files) into R. Since Prism5 (the current version as of mid 2018 is Prism7), Prism stores its data tables in `XML` format and is possible to be parsed into `data.frame`s in R. The `pzfx` package contains functions to list and load Prism tables into R, through parsing the `XML` by the package `xml2`.

# Main functionality
There are only two main functions in the package. `pzfx_tables` lists the tables in a `.pzfx` file. `read_pzfx` reads one table into R from a `.pzfx` file.

We use a Prism example file `exponential_decay.pzfx` to show how these two functions work. Here is the screen shot of this file when opened in Prism. ![data](../inst/extdata/exponential_decay.png){width=100%}

List tables from a `.pzfx` file:

```{r}
library(pzfx)
pzfx_tables(system.file("extdata/exponential_decay.pzfx", package="pzfx"))
```

Read one specific table into R by table name:

```{r}
df <- read_pzfx(system.file("extdata/exponential_decay.pzfx", package="pzfx"), table="Exponential decay")
head(df)
```

Read one specific table into R by table index (1-based):

```{r}
df <- read_pzfx(system.file("extdata/exponential_decay.pzfx", package="pzfx"), table=1)
head(df)
```

# Additional notes
- Prism allows subcolumns. To accommodate this, `read_pzfx` automatically adds `_1`, `_2` etc to the original column name to account for sub columns if they represent replicates. It tries to infer the subcolumn types and adds appropriate suffix accordingly. For example, trailing `_MEAN`, `_SD`, `_N` are added if subcolumns represent mean, standard deviation and number of observations.

- Prism does not require columns in a table to be of the same length. To accommodate this, `NA`s are added if the columns are of different lengths.

- Prism allows user to exclude data by striking them out individual observations. To accommodate this, an option `strike_action` is available in `read_pzfx`. One can choose to delete these values with `strike_action="exclude"`, keep them with `"keep"`, or convert them to a trailing "*" (as they appear in Prism) with `"star"`. Note if `strike_action="star"` the entire table is converted to type `character`. 

- Prism allows special formating of column names such as superscripts. When reading into R, column names with special formating are converted to regular strings.
